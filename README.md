### DevChallenge #2

I've created this project to challenge myself. I took inspiration from [this challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD).
These challenges are important to keep your mind sharp. They can look easy and all but you always learn a thing or two from them.

For example, the most fun part in this case was to come up with an algorithm to create a search engine. It was quite challenging.
I've combined my own strategy with an approach based on [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).
You can check the original code [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10473745/compare-strings-javascript-return-of-likely).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.12.
